To run the MessageBox, download jQuery and put it into /lib/jquery.js.

After running MessageBox you can goto http://yourip:8000/
which runs a messaging test. 
Testing on different machines can be done with /sender and /receiver

# Sending Messages
/send?user=1&to=2&message={"test":"success"}

#Receiving Messages 
/receive?user=2&session=ABCD1234

The session identifies a receiver,
if you have more than one receiver for the same user.


Happy coding!
